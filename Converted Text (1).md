LIBRARIES IN R

Bioinformatics is a crucial field that merges biological studies with computational methods to analyze biological data. Within the realm of cancer research, bioinformatics plays a key role in analyzing large-scale datasets, including genomic sequences, to uncover the underlying mechanisms behind cancer growth and progression (Zhao, et al., 2019). Numerous tools are available for bioinformatics, with the R programming language being particularly notable and it did stand out for its extensive library ecosystem, which supports a very wide range of analyses crucially essential for cancer research (Giorgi, et al., 2020).

R is an open-source programming language primarily used for statistical, wide computing and visualization. It is among the most popular languages in bioinformatics world, capable of handling and examining large datasets efficiently (Giorgi, et al., 2020). It offers a comprehensive collection of statistical and graphical methods while also simplifying the process of data visualization and presentation in a clear, understanding and concise manner. R also provides a broad selection of tools and methods for analyzing biological data.

R applications include code, data, and documentation in a standardized format that can be shared among R users, often through a centralized software repository like CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network) (Hornik & Kurt (2020).

R libraries are pre-built collections that can enhance R's capabilities and effectiveness allowing researchers to perform specialized tasks without needing to write code from the ground up. In cancer research, these libraries are particularly valuable for tasks such as analyzing genomic data, statistical modeling, and visualization (Gorelick,et al.,2017). The significance of these libraries lies in their ability to handle large and complex datasets, enabling researchers to identify patterns and correlations that could lead to new understandings in cancer biology and possible corrections.

Some of the libraries in R include Shiny, Plotly, Ggplot2, Dplyr, MLR, Ggmap, Caret, Knitr, Lubridate, Tidyr, Leaflet, Lattice, Dygraphs, RColorBrewer, Esquisse, and more.

R programming is utilized in bioinformatics for various applications, ranging from statistical visualization and analysis to genomics and machine learning (Giorgi, et al., 2020). It provides a wide array of tools and techniques for manipulating data, which is crucial for working with extensive biological datasets. For instance, the dplyr package is used for data cleaning and preprocessing, simplifying the analysis and interpretation of data received.

Additionally, the Bioconductor project serves as a major repository for R packages designed for bioinformatics applications(www\.carpentries-incubator).
